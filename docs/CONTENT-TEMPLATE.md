Hi, I'm Sarabjit Singh Dhaliwal—a no-code/low-code developer who builds AI-powered tools that solve real problems.

I specialize in helping content creators and SMBs automate their workflows with custom software. From image optimization to AI writing assistants, I build solutions that actually work—not just prototypes.

## About Section

### Full About Copy (300 words)
```
## From Automations to Impactful Tools

My journey started with a simple question: "Why does this have to be so complicated?"

As a content creator myself, I was frustrated by tedious workflows—resizing images, converting files, publishing across platforms. I knew there had to be a better way.

That's when I discovered no-code/low-code development.

### What I Do Today

I build custom software that solves real creator and SMB problems:

**For Content Creators:**
- Automated content pipelines (draft to publish in one flow)
- Image/video workflow tools (like PicShifter)
- AI writing assistants (like Writola)

**For SMBs:**
- Custom SaaS applications
- API integrations (Facebook, LinkedIn, OpenAI)
- Workflow automation that saves hours daily

### My Tech Stack

I work with:
- **Platforms:** Bubble, Webflow, Airtable
- **Automation:** Zapier, Make.com, n8n
- **AI:** OpenAI API, Claude, Custom models
- **Integrations:** Facebook API, LinkedIn API, REST APIs

### Why I Build This Way

"No code bloat" is my philosophy. I build what you need—nothing more, nothing less. Every feature solves a specific problem for your users or your business.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably thinking about the next tool to build. Have an idea? Let's explore it together.
