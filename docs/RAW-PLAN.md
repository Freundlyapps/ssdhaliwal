Comprehensive Portfolio Website Plan for a Serious No-Code/Low-Code Developer

name: Sarabjit Singh Dhaliwal
Domain name: ssdhaliwal.dev

Based on our full discussion—your broad expertise in building AI-driven SaaS, websites, and solutions for real-world problems (especially for content creators), plus your standout projects like the open-sourced PicShifter.com (image optimizer), PDFtoImage.PicShifter.com (free PDF-to-image tool), Writola.com (beta AI writing/publishing SaaS), and your upcoming AI video generation app—I've crafted this end-to-end plan. It draws from real-world best practices: simple, polished designs that prioritize usability, quick loading, and credibility (inspired by examples from sites like Hostinger's 25 developer portfolios, WeAreDevelopers' top 23, and no-code-focused guides from Supercharge.design and Reddit threads). The goal is to position you as a professional, versatile developer who delivers tangible value, turning social media clicks (LinkedIn, X/Twitter) into consultations or collaborations.
This plan is actionable in the real world: Build it in 3–5 days using no-code tools (no irony—practice what you preach). Budget: $20–50/month for pro features/domain. Focus on mobile-first (60–70% of traffic), SEO for terms like "no-code AI for content creators," and accessibility (e.g., alt text, keyboard nav). It avoids overkill—minimalist yet engaging, with live demos to showcase "from-scratch" builds.
1. Purpose and Overall Strategy

Core Positioning: "Versatile No-Code/Low-Code AI Builder: Solving Real Creator and SMB Problems with Custom Tools—from Scratch." Highlight your passion for content creators (e.g., "Empowering bloggers, YouTubers, and indie makers with AI workflows") while noting broader applicability (e.g., "Scales to mid-business ops like inventory AI").
Target Audience: Content creators (primary), SMB owners, potential collaborators (e.g., via open-source).
Key Metrics for Success: Aim for 50%+ conversion rate on CTAs (e.g., beta sign-ups); track with Google Analytics.
Differentiation: Embed live project demos (e.g., PicShifter iframe) to prove skills. Use metrics like "10k+ PicShifter uses" for credibility. No fluff—focus on "real issues solved" with before/after stories.

2. Tech Stack and Setup

Platform: Webflow (top recommendation from no-code portfolio guides). Why? Drag-and-drop UI design, CMS for easy updates, native embeds for your tools, and SEO/forms. It's pro-level no-code, aligning with your services (e.g., demo Webflow-built sites). Alternatives: Framer for more interactive AI vibes (if video app teasers need animations); Carrd for a quicker MVP if time's tight.
Free to design; $14–29/month hosting.

Domain: Custom like yourname.dev or creatorai.dev ($10–15/year via Namecheap/GoDaddy). Redirect picshifter.com/writola.com links here for cohesion.
Additional Tools:
Forms: Native Webflow or Typeform embed.
Analytics: Google Analytics/Tag Manager (free).
SEO: Webflow's built-in; add meta tags for social previews.
Hosting: Webflow's CDN for speed (<2s loads).

Build Timeline: Day 1: Wireframe/structure. Day 2: UI design/content. Day 3: Embeds/demos. Day 4: Mobile tests/SEO. Day 5: Launch.

3. UI/UX Design Principles (End-to-End)
Drawing from UI best practices (e.g., Figma's 7 principles: hierarchy, consistency, contrast; plus dev-specific tips like clean nav from DesignModo and Medium's Traversy article), design for simplicity and impact. Theme: Modern minimalist—dark/light mode toggle (for creators editing at night), sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter for readability), vibrant accents (blue/orange for AI/creator energy). Layout: Full-width sections with subtle animations (e.g., fade-ins on scroll via Webflow interactions). Ensure WCAG accessibility: High contrast (4.5:1 ratio), semantic HTML, ARIA labels.

Color Palette: Primary: #007BFF (blue for trust/AI). Accent: #FF9500 (orange for creativity). Neutral: #FFFFFF/#1A1A1A (bg), #666 (text).
Typography: H1: 48px bold (hero). Body: 16px regular. Use hierarchy: Bold for headings, italics for quotes.
Spacing/Proximity: 32px section padding; group related elements (e.g., project cards in grids).
Consistency/Alignment: Grid-based layout; left-align text; centered CTAs.
Contrast/Progressive Disclosure: Dark text on light bg; reveal details on hover (e.g., project metrics).
Navigation: Sticky top bar: Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Blog, Contact. Mobile: Hamburger menu.
Interactions: Smooth scrolls; hover effects on buttons (scale 1.05); modals for demo embeds.
Responsive Design: Breakpoints: Desktop (grid layouts), Tablet (stacked), Mobile (single-column, touch-friendly buttons >44px).

Promotion: Link in bios; share on X/LinkedIn: "Launched my portfolio—check PicShifter demo!"
Maintenance: Webflow CMS for quick edits (e.g., add video app on launch). Update quarterly.
Growth Path: Add e-comm for premium tools; integrate Stripe for consult bookings.

This plan works IRL: It's inspired by successful portfolios (e.g., SamDickie.me's no-code build) and avoids common pitfalls (over-complication, per Reddit/Dev.to).
 You'll come across as a pro who ships value. If you share wireframes or specifics (e.g., color prefs), I can refine further!

Theme Colors for Dark and Light Modes
Implement modes with a toggle switcher (sun/moon icons) in the header/footer. Use CSS variables in Webflow for easy switching. Base on your existing palette (#007BFF blue for trust/AI, #FF9500 orange for creativity), but adjusted for modes:

Light Mode (Default, for bright environments):
Background (body/sections): #FFFFFF (pure white for clean canvas).
Text (body/headings): #1A1A1A (near-black for high contrast).
Primary (buttons/links, e.g., CTAs): #007BFF (vibrant blue).
Accent (highlights/icons, e.g., tags): #FF9500 (energetic orange).
Neutral/Secondary (borders/cards): #E0E0E0 (light gray).
Hover/Active: Darken primary/accent by 10% (e.g., #006FE6 for blue).

Dark Mode (For low-light, reduces eye strain):
Background (body/sections): #121212 (dark gray, not #000000 to avoid harshness and improve readability).
Text (body/headings): #E0E0E0 (light gray for contrast without glare).
Primary (buttons/links): #4DA6FF (lighter, desaturated blue to meet WCAG on dark bg).
Accent (highlights/icons): #FFB74D (softer orange, less saturated to prevent vibrancy overload).
Neutral/Secondary (borders/cards): #333333 (mid-gray for layering).
Hover/Active: Lighten primary/accent by 10% (e.g., #66B3FF for blue).


These ensure accessibility: E.g., #E0E0E0 text on #121212 bg has ~15:1 contrast (far above 4.5:1). Test with tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker post-build.
Implementing the Dark/Light Switcher

UI: Toggle button (e.g., slider with sun 🌞 / moon 🌙 icons, 40px size) in top-right nav. Label: "Theme" with ARIA ("Toggle dark mode").
How in Webflow:
Use custom code: Add <script> in site settings to detect OS preference (media query @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)), store user choice in localStorage, and toggle class (e.g., .dark-mode) on body.
CSS Variables: Define in :root { --bg: #FFFFFF; --text: #1A1A1A; ... } and override in .dark-mode { --bg: #121212; --text: #E0E0E0; ... }. Apply vars site-wide (e.g., background: var(--bg)).
Interactions: Webflow's native for toggle animation (fade/switch).

Persistence: Saves across sessions; respects system settings initially.

Anything Else to Pay Attention To

Accessibility:
Ensure all text meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 contrast)—avoid low-contrast combos like gray-on-gray.
ARIA labels for switcher/icons; keyboard-navigable (tab focus).
Alt text for images in notes (e.g., "Diagram of PicShifter workflow").
Test with screen readers (e.g., VoiceOver) and color-blind simulators (e.g., Chrome DevTools).

Performance:
Lazy-load images/code blocks in notes to keep load <2s.
Minify CSS/JS; use Webflow's optimization.
If embedding demos (e.g., Writola previews), ensure they adapt to mode (pass theme prop).

SEO/Content Strategy:
Each note: Unique title/meta description with keywords (e.g., "No-Code AI Video Gen Tips").
Update regularly (1–2/month) to drive traffic from social shares.
Cross-link to portfolio (e.g., "See this in action on PicShifter").

Mobile/Responsive:
Stack cards vertically; enlarge toggle for touch (48px hit area).
Test on real devices—dark mode often auto-triggers on phones.

Security/Privacy:
If adding comments/forms, use CAPTCHA; no user data storage without GDPR notice.
Open-source notes? Link to GitHub for code snippets.

Testing & Iteration:
Browser test: Chrome, Safari, Firefox (dark mode quirks).
User feedback: Share beta site on X/LinkedIn for input.
Analytics: Track engagement on notes (e.g., time on page) to refine.
